# Why I Chose Hugo for My Developer Portfolio

After building several Laravel applications and learning Docker, I needed a way to showcase my work professionally. Here's why Hugo became my go-to solution.

## The Problem

As a developer, I needed:
- A professional portfolio to showcase projects
- Documentation sites for my APIs
- A platform for technical blogging
- Fast, mobile-friendly websites
- Easy maintenance and updates

## The Hugo Solution

Hugo solved all these problems with:

### 1. Lightning-Fast Performance
Hugo sites load in milliseconds because they're static HTML files. No database queries, no server-side processing.

### 2. Developer-Friendly Workflow
- Write content in Markdown
- Version control with Git  
- Deploy anywhere
- No security updates needed

### 3. Beautiful Themes
Hundreds of professional themes available, or create your own.

### 4. Perfect for Documentation
Built-in features for:
- Code syntax highlighting
- Table of contents generation
- Cross-references
- Multi-language support

## Getting Started

1. Install Hugo: `brew install hugo`
2. Create site: `hugo new site my-site`
3. Add theme: `git submodule add [theme-url] themes/theme-name`
4. Create content: `hugo new posts/my-first-post.md`
5. Develop: `hugo server -D`
6. Build: `hugo`
7. Deploy: Upload `public/` folder

## My Results

- **Setup time**: 30 minutes vs 8+ hours for custom development
- **Performance**: 0.2 second page loads vs 2+ seconds for WordPress
- **Hosting cost**: Free vs $10+/month
- **Maintenance**: Zero vs weekly updates

## Next Steps

I'm planning to:
- Document my Laravel APIs with Hugo
- Create project showcases
- Write technical tutorials
- Build a complete developer portfolio

Hugo has transformed how I think about web development. For static content, it's simply the best solution available.
